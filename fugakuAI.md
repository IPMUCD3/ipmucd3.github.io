## Intro
We aim at solving problems in astronomy and cosmology by combining world-class simulations by Fugaku with AI. In this workshop, the members of three Fugaku projects on astrophysics and earth science will gather together to share research results using simulations and machine learning in a wide range of topics, including large-scale scale structure, galaxies, stars, and planets, and to discuss future AI applications in these fields. In addition to keynote talks and research presentations, we are planning to have a collaborative hack session using Google Colab.
