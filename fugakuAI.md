- You can use eduroam

Language: \
Presentations and slides are in English. \
The Q&A can be in Japanese if needed. \
We will have one introductory talk in Japanese.

## Introduction
We aim to solve problems in astrophysics and cosmology by combining world-class simulations by Fugaku with AI. In this workshop, the members of three Fugaku projects on astrophysics, earth science, and cosmology will gather together to share research results using simulations and machine learning on a wide range of topics, including large-scale scale structure, galaxy formation, stellar evolution, and planets. We will discuss future AI applications in these fields. In addition to keynote talks and research presentations, we will have a collaborative hack session.
