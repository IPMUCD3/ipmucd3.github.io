## AstroAI Asian Network (A<sup>3</sup> Net)
The AstroAI Asian Network (A<sup>3</sup> Net) aims to educate students and researchers on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods for astrophysics, with a focus on building a network in Asia. 

We will have our second summer school from August 18-22, 2025 in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Targeting students and early-career researchers, this one-week program includes theoretical lectures, hands-on exercises, and collaborative projects. Participants will explore the latest advancements in AI/ML techniques and their applications in solving complex astrophysical problems.
