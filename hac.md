## Introduction
The "Human-AI Collaboration" program aims to investigate the potential of AI to accelerate scientific discovery. We will collect scientific ideas from CD3 members on broad topics such as particle physics, astrophysics, cosmology, mathematics, high-energy physics, and social science. We will then pair humans and AI to conduct parallel research on each project. By the end of the program, we will deliver a framework for evaluating AI in scientific research, a comparative analysis of AI and human research capabilities, a report on ethical and social implications, and recommendations for future human-AI collaboration in scientific research.
