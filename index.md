Our mission is to decode the universe. We are dedicated to advancing our understanding of the universe through the innovative use of data science and machine learning techniques, by fostering a collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment, and by engaging with the broader scientific community and society.

The Center for Data-Driven Discovery (CD3) is part of the [Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe](https://www.ipmu.jp/) (Kavli IPMU). It is supported by [MEXT](https://www.mext.go.jp/en/) through the [University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) and in part by the [Kavli Foundation](https://kavlifoundation.org/).
