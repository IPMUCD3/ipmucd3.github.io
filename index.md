The Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (Kavli IPMU) at the University of Tokyo invites applications for a tenure-track assistant or associate professor position in our new Center for Data-Driven Discovery, led by Jia Liu (director), Masahiro Takada, Tomotake Matsumura, and other faculty members at Kavli IPMU. The mission of Kavli IPMU is to discover the fundamental laws of Nature and use them to solve the deepest mysteries of the Universe by bringing mathematicians, physicists, and astronomers together and using theoretical and observational/experimental methods. 

Kavli IPMU is a leading institute of the [Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) imaging survey](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/), the upcoming [Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) survey](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/), both with the 8.2m Subaru Telescope, and the [LiteBIRD CMB satellite](https://www.ipmu.jp/en/research-activities/research-program/LiteBIRD). Faculty members at Kavli IPMU are also actively involved in other projects such as the Rubin Observatory LSST, Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, Super-Kamiokande, Hyper-Kamiokande, T2K, XENON, and Belle-II. Given the unprecedented precision of these data, we are facing new statistical and computational challenges. The successful candidate is expected to have a strong record in computationally intensive research programs such as, but not limited to, data analysis, data mining, algorithm development, machine learning, numerical simulations, and high performance computing. We are particularly excited for candidates who are ready to lead interdisciplinary research programs. Large computing resources are available locally at Kavli IPMU, the University of Tokyo, and on the national level.

Kavli IPMU provides unique research and life experiences for its members. It is an international research hub, receiving more than 600 visitors each year from overseas before the pandemic (now our visitors are coming back). New scientific collaborations are regularly fostered by our highly interactive and interdisciplinary environment, such as the daily 3pm "tea time" where astronomers, physicists, and mathematicians gather to exchange ideas. With minimal administrative duties, the members are provided with ample freedom and time to explore their topics of interest. We strive to improve equity, diversity, and inclusion at the Kavli IPMU ([Code of Conduct](https://www.ipmu.jp/en/CodeofConduct)). We particularly encourage applicants from groups that are underrepresented in science, such as women and gender minorities, persons with disabilities, and those from diverse cultural backgrounds. Members can access on-site childcare and are entitled to paid parental leave. A support team is available to the members and their families to facilitate everyday living in Japan. Members are encouraged to work abroad for up to three months per year.

The application should include a cover letter, CV, publication list, research statement, and at least three letters of recommendation. They should be uploaded through AcademicJobsOnline at <https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/23386/apply>. (You need the registration of AcademicJobsOnline.org)

The search is open until filled, but for full consideration please submit the application and letters by January 15, 2023.


Personal information received through this application process will not be used for any other purposes.

Due to recent revisions of the Japanese government rules on protection of personal information and on foreign trades, we are required to include this link to this solicitation.
