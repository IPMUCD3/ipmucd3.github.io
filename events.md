Every Friday 1:30-5pm, Seminar room C (3F)
* The goal: code, experiment, and connect!
* The format: 1:30pm describes your goal of the session; 2-4:30pm find a comfy place to code (together or alone); 4:30-5pm reconvene and report back your accomplishments (or failures..) and get feedback from others.
* What to bring: a laptop, a small challenge that is explorable on a time scale of an afternoon, and an open mind!
* Who can/should join: anyone who codes. This should be of minimal burden to your work/life, so feel free to join and leave anytime.
