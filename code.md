Here we list the data products and codes released by our members and projects.

## Observation

**[Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/){:target="_blank"}** 

The latest public release (third release) of HSC-SSP occurred on 31 August 2021.  The release includes over 600 square degrees of deep multi-color data served through dedicated databases and user interfaces.

## Software

**[Galight](https://github.com/dartoon/galight){:target="_blank"}**

Galight is a Python-based open-source package that performs two-dimensional model fitting of optical and near-infrared images to characterize the light distribution of galaxies with components including a disk, bulge, bar, and quasar. The decomposition of stellar components has been demonstrated in published studies of inactive galaxies and quasar host galaxies observed by the HSC, HST and JWST.

**[CosmoMMF](https://github.com/James11222/CosmoMMF){:target="_blank"}**

A julia code for Multiscale Morphological Analysis (MMF) of cosmological simulations. CosmoMMF identifies clusters, filaments, walls, and voids using a modified version of the NEXUS algorithm ([Cautun et al. 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2043){:target="_blank"}), where the density Hessian-based halo identification scheme in NEXUS is replaced by a halo catalog-based tagging method.

## Simulation

**[kappaTNG](https://github.com/0satoken/kappaTNG){:target="_blank"}** 

The kappaTNG is a suite of mock weak lensing maps based on the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1). We also include the kappaTNG-Dark suit of maps, generated based on the corresponding dark matter-only TNG simulations. These mock maps are suitable for studying the effects of baryons on weak lensing.

**[MassiveNuS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10524){:target="_blank"}** (Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations)\
MassiveNuS is a suite of 100 massive neutrino simulations (+ 1 massless model). The snapshots, halo catalogues, merger trees, and CMB and weak lensing convergence maps are generated using Gadget-2, kspace-neutrino, halotools, rockstar, consistent tree, and LensTools.
