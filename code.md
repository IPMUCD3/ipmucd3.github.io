Data products and softwares released by our members and projects.

## Observational Data Release

**[Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/){:target="_blank"}** ([data access](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/data-release/){:target="_blank"})\
The latest public release (third release) of HSC-SSP includes over 600 square degrees of deep multi-color data served through dedicated databases and user interfaces.

## Software

**[Galight](https://github.com/dartoon/galight){:target="_blank"}**\
Galight is a Python-based open-source package that performs two-dimensional model fitting of optical and near-infrared images to characterize the light distribution of galaxies with components including a disk, bulge, bar, and quasar. The decomposition of stellar components has been demonstrated in published studies of inactive galaxies and quasar host galaxies observed by the HSC, HST and JWST.


**[CosmoMMF](https://github.com/James11222/CosmoMMF){:target="_blank"}
A julia based code for Multiscale Morphological Analysis (MMF) of cosmological simulations, developed as part of [Sunseri et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PhRvD.107b3514S/abstract){:target="_blank"}. CosmoMMF identifies clusters, filaments, walls, and voids using a modified version of the NEXUS algorithm ([Cautun et al. 2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2043){:target="_blank"}), where the density Hessian-based halo identification scheme in NEXUS is replaced by a halo catalog-based tagging method.

## Simulation

**[kappaTNG](https://github.com/0satoken/kappaTNG){:target="_blank"}** 
The kappaTNG is a suite of mock weak lensing maps based on the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1). We also include the kappaTNG-Dark suit of maps, generated based on the corresponding dark matter-only TNG simulations. These mock maps are suitable for studying the effects of baryons on weak lensing. (code release paper: [arxiv:2010.09731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09731){:target="_blank"})


**[MassiveNuS](http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/aklypin/SUsimulations/MassiveNuS/){:target="_blank"}** (Cosmological Massive Neutrino Simulations)\
MassiveNuS is a suite of 100 massive neutrino simulations (+ 1 massless model). The snapshots, halo catalogues, merger trees, and CMB and weak lensing convergence maps are generated using Gadget-2, kspace-neutrino, halotools, rockstar, consistent tree, and LensTools. (code release paper: [arxiv:1711.10524](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10524){:target="_blank"})
