Data products and softwares released by our members and projects.

## Observational Data Release

**[Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/){:target="_blank"}** ([data access](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/data-release/){:target="_blank"})\
The latest public release (third release) of HSC-SSP includes over 600 square degrees of deep multi-color data served through dedicated databases and user interfaces.

## Software

**[Galight](https://github.com/dartoon/galight){:target="_blank"}**\
A Python-based open-source package that performs two-dimensional model fitting of optical and near-infrared images to characterize the light distribution of galaxies with components including a disk, bulge, bar, and quasar. 

**[Yomikata](https://github.com/passaglia/yomikata){:target="_blank"}**\
Yomikata uses context to resolve ambiguous words in Japanese ([Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/passaglia/yomikata-demo){:target="_blank"}).

**[CosmoMMF](https://github.com/James11222/CosmoMMF){:target="_blank"}**\
A julia based code that identifies clusters, filaments, walls, and voids using a modified version of the NEXUS algorithm, developed as part of [Sunseri et al. 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PhRvD.107b3514S/abstract){:target="_blank"}. 

## Simulation

**[kappaTNG](https://github.com/0satoken/kappaTNG){:target="_blank"}** ([arxiv:2010.09731](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09731){:target="_blank"})\
A suite of mock weak lensing maps based on the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations IllustrisTNG (TNG300-1), suitable for studying the effects of baryons on weak lensing. 

**[MassiveNuS](http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/aklypin/SUsimulations/MassiveNuS/){:target="_blank"}** ([arxiv:1711.10524](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10524){:target="_blank"})\
A suite of 100 cosmological massive neutrino simulations (+ 1 massless model), with snapshots, halo catalogues, merger trees, and CMB and weak lensing convergence maps. 

**[IllustrisTNG in the HSC-SSP](www.tng-project.org/bottrell23){:target="_blank"}** ([arxiv:2308.14793](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14793){:target="_blank"})\
Synthetic images of galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations made using dust radiative transfer post-processing with SKIRT. The images are designed to match the observational characteristics of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. Both “HSC-realistic” and noise-free, high-resolution versions of the images are available.
