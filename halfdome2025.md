### Introduction

The HalfDome team will meet this week to recap our past year's work and plan for the next year. The [HalfDome Cosmological Simulations](https://halfdomesims.github.io/) are tailored to the joint analysis of ongoing and upcoming cosmological surveys such as DESI, PFS, Rubin LSST, Euclid, SPHEREx, Roman, Simons Observatory, and LiteBIRD. These surveys have the potential to reach groundbreaking discoveries on multiple fronts such as the neutrino mass, dark energy, and inflation. However, these key science goals require the joint analysis of multiple datasets to break parameter degeneracies and calibrate systematics. By modeling the multi-wavelength observables in a correlated manner, our simulations are designed to enable such analyses.

### Information

Time: Aug 25-29, 2025 (Monday 2pm - Friday 5pm) \
