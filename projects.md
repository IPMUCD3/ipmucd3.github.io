**<font size="25">HSC</font>**\
Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) is a prime focus camera at the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. Anyone who is working at an institute in Japan has the right of full data access (access to the proprietary data/data products). To join the HSC collaboration, please visit the page [Information for New Members](https://hscsurvey.pbworks.com/w/page/19661930/FrontPage).

**<font size="25">PFS</font>**\
Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) is a massively-multiplexed fiber-fed optical and near-infrared 3-arm spectrograph (2400 fibers, lambda=380-1260nm, 1.3 degree diameter FoV) at the Subaru Telescope. We envision we will start our survey from around 2024. Anyone who is working at an institute in Japan has the right of full data access for PFS. If you want to join the PFS collaboration, please register [here](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/research/regist_collab.html).

**<font size="25">LiteBIRD</font>**\
LiteBIRD is a satellite that will search for primordial gravitational waves emitted during the cosmic inflation era (around 10–38 sec after the beginning of the Universe). It aims to test representative inflationary models (single-ﬁeld slow-role models with large ﬁeld variation) by performing an all-sky CMB polarization survey. In addition to inflation science, LiteBIRD can deliver comprehensive science outputs: reionization history and neutrino mass, cosmic birefringence, Galactic sciences, and more.

**<font size="25">LSST</font>**\
For the first ten years of operation, Vera C. Rubin Observatory will perform the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) , using the 3.2 Gigapixel Rubin Observatory LSST Camera and the 8.4-m Simonyi Survey Telescope. Work toward meeting the LSST science goals is being carried out by the Rubin Observatory LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). Key working groups are Weak gravitational lensing, Large-scale structure, Type Ia Supernovae, Galaxy clusters, and Strong gravitational lensing.
