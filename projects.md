**[Hyper Suprime-Cam](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/){:target="_blank"}** (HSC) is a prime focus camera at the 8.2m Subaru Telescope. Anyone who is working at an institute in Japan has the right of full access to the proprietary data. To join the HSC collaboration, please visit [this page](https://hscsurvey.pbworks.com/w/page/19661930/FrontPage){:target="_blank"}.

**[Prime Focus Spectrograph](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/){:target="_blank"}** (PFS) is a massively-multiplexed fiber-fed optical and near-infrared 3-arm spectrograph (2400 fibers, lambda=380-1260nm, 1.3 degree diameter FoV) at the Subaru Telescope. The survey begins around 2024. Anyone who is working at an institute in Japan has the right of full access to the proprietary data. If you want to join the PFS collaboration, please register [here](https://pfs.ipmu.jp/research/regist_collab.html){:target="_blank"}.

**[LiteBIRD](https://www.ipmu.jp/en/research-activities/research-program/LiteBIRD){:target="_blank"}** is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) satellite that will search for primordial gravitational waves emitted during the cosmic inflation era (around 10–38 sec after the beginning of the Universe). It aims to test representative inflationary models (single-ﬁeld slow-role models with large ﬁeld variation) by performing an all-sky CMB polarization survey. In addition to inflation science, LiteBIRD can deliver comprehensive science outputs: reionization history and neutrino mass, cosmic birefringence, Galactic sciences, and more.

For the first ten years of operation, Vera Rubin Observatory will perform the **[Legacy Survey of Space and Time](https://www.lsst.org/){:target="_blank"}** (LSST) , using the 3.2 Gigapixel Rubin Observatory LSST Camera and the 8.4-m Simonyi Survey Telescope. Work toward understanding the nature of dark energy with the survey is being carried out by the LSST **[Dark Energy Science Collaboration](https://lsstdesc.org/){:target="_blank"}** (DESC).

The **[Simons Observatoryhttps://simonsobservatory.org/{:target="_blank"}** (SO) is a ground-based CMB experiment situated on Cerrro Toco, 5300 m (17,000 feet) above the Atacama Desert in Chile. SO key targets are: the physics of primordial perturbations, identifying the correct model of an early inflationary epoch of the Universe; effective number of relativistic species; the sum of neutrino masses; observable deviations from the cosmological constant paradigm; galaxy evolution; redshift and duration of the reionization epoch.

**[CMB-S4](https://cmb-s4.org/){:target="_blank"}** is the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background experiment, expected to start operation in early 2030s. With 21 telescopes at the South Pole and in the Chilean Atacama desert surveying the sky with over 500,000 cryogenically-cooled superconducting detectors for 7 years, CMB-S4 will deliver transformative discoveries in fundamental physics, cosmology, astrophysics, and astronomy.

**[Super-Kamiokande](https://www-sk.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/sk/){:target="_blank"}** is the world’s largest water Cherenkov detector. Its detector consists of a stainless-steel tank, 39.3m diameter and 41.4m tall, filled with 50,000 tons of water. About 13,000 photo-multipliers are installed on the tank wall. The detector is located at 1,000 meter underground in the Kamioka-mine, Hida-city, Gifu, Japan. Its key scientific goals are elucidation of neutrino properties, observations of the universe by neutrino, search for proton decay, and observation of supernova relic neutrino.

**[Hyper-Kamiokande](https://www.hyperk.org/){:target="_blank"}** is to be the next generation of large-scale water Cherenkov detectors.  It is planned to be an order of magnitude bigger than its predecessor, Super-K, with the optimal design consisting of two half megaton tanks equiped with ultra high sensitivity photosensors. The Hyper-Kamiokande detector is both a “microscope,” used to observe elementary particles, and also a “telescope” for observing the Sun and supernovas, using neutrinos.

**[T2K](https://t2k-experiment.org/){:target="_blank"}**  (Tokai to Kamioka) is a long-baseline neutrino experiment in Japan, and is studying neutrino oscillations. 

<img src="/_images/logo_xenon.png" style="height: 80px;">\
**[XENON](https://xenonexperiment.org/){:target="_blank"}** is a direct search experiment for dark matter with liquid Xenon. It locates deep underground at the INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, Italy.

<img src="/_images/logo_belleII.png" style="height: 80px;">\  
**[Belle-II](https://www.belle2.org/){:target="_blank"}**, the first super B-Factory experiment, is designed to make precise measurements of weak interaction parameters and find NP (New Physics) beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. It is at the SuperKEKB accelerator complex at KEK in Tsukuba, Ibaraki prefecture, Japan.
