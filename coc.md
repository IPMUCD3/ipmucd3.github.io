1. Discrimination, harassment, and retaliation of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to, discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, religion, and age.

1. Follow the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification of data.

1. Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and policies governing research, including but not limited to those related to data privacy, data security and data protection.

1. Any behavior that is deemed to be in violation of this code of conduct will result in disciplinary action, up to and including expulsion from the Center. If you feel that you or others have been subjected to behavior that is in violation of this code of conduct, please contact the Center's Director or the Director of the Kavli IPMU.
