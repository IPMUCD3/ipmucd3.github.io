## Overview

While Deep Learning's potential in industry and the sciences is without question,
a fundamental theoretical understanding of large artificial networks is thus far elusive.
There is growing evidence that tools from theoretical physics, in particular quantum field theory
and statistical mechanics, will be crucial to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

As recognized by the 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics, the early stages of artificial intelligence development
were heavily influenced by theoretical physics.
This mini-workshop aims to retrace the physical ideas behind early models and connect them
with the statistical description of modern deep networks.
This event brings together researchers from the entire spectrum between machine learning practice and high-energy theory.
We hope to initiate fruitful collaboration between the different communities.

The talks up to tea time will be designed for a general physics audience.
During the subsequent discussion, we will deepen the discussed topics and find points of contact.
