## Code of Conduct

CD3 is committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for all members of our community. To achieve this goal, we have established the following code of conduct:
- Treat each other with respect and professionalism. Discrimination, harassment, and retaliation of any kind will not be tolerated. 
- Follow the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. This includes, but is not limited to, avoiding plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification of data. All members are required to comply with Kavli IPMU's [Research Ethics](https://www.ipmu.jp/node/1801){:target="_blank}. 
- Researchers using AI tools such as ChatGPT should document this use in the methods, acknowledgements, or other appropriate sections in the paper. Do not use AI tools as a credited author on a research paper, as it can not carry accountability. (Guidance provided by [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-023-00191-1){:target="_blank}).

We are dedicated to providing a positive and productive environment for all members of this community.
