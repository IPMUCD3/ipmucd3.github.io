## AstroAI Asian Network (A<sup>3</sup> Net)
The AstroAI Asian Network (A<sup>3</sup> Net) aims to educate students and researchers on artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods for astrophysics, with a focus on building a network in Asia. 

We're having our annual summer school in various locations in Asia region. Targeting students and early-career researchers, this one-week program includes theoretical lectures, hands-on exercises, and collaborative projects. Participants will explore the latest advancements in AI/ML techniques and their applications in solving complex astrophysical problems.

## The AstroAI Asian Network Seminar Series (A<sup>3</sup>NSS)

### Multinational Online Seminars on AI/ML for Astrophysics and Cosmology

The **AstroAI Asian Network Seminar Series (A<sup>3</sup>NSS)** is a multinational, online seminar platform dedicated to exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in astrophysics and cosmology, as well as the physical modelling and understanding of AI/ML technologies. The series provides members of the AstroAI Asian Network with a forum to present recent research, exchange ideas, and build collaborations.

### Mission and Scope

A<sup>3</sup>NSS aims to:

- showcase cutting-edge research applying AI/ML techniques to astrophysics and cosmology;
- support a strong regional community of scientists developing and using AI/ML tools;
- encourage dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, and theorists working on the physical and mathematical foundations of intelligent systems;
- strengthen collaboration across institutions within the A<sup>3</sup>N and beyond.

Topics include AI/ML applications to observational or theoretical cosmology; physical modelling of AI/ML systems and theoretical frameworks for intelligent computation; methodological or technical advances in AI/ML science with relevance to astronomy or cosmology.

### Format

Seminars are held online on a biweekly or monthly schedule. Each session features a 30–45 minute presentation followed by discussion.

### Call for Abstracts

A<sup>3</sup>NSS invites abstract submissions on any research area linking AI/ML and astrophysics/cosmology, as well as theoretical studies of AI/ML technologies. Researchers at all career stages, including early career researchers, are encouraged to submit.
